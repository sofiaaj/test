## 1. Data overview

**Job risk model**

We use Pulse data from phase 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. The data for these
phases pertain to data collected across the following periods:

-   Phase 3.1: April 14, 2021 -- July 5, 2021
-   Phase 3.2: July 21, 2021 -- October 11, 2021
-   Phase 3.3: December 1, 2021 -- February 7, 2022
-   Phase 3.4: March 2, 2022 - May 9, 2022

Pulse surveys prior to phase 3.1 do not contain the question about the
job setting of respondents that allows us to categorize employees.

**Omicron concerns + impetus for creating risk of infection by specific
severity levels**

The period starting from mid-Phase 3.3 and continuing for phase 3.4
contains data collected during a time of high prevalence of the Omicron
variant. Using CDC data on variant proportions, we see that beginning
with the week ending on December 27, 2021, the Omicron variant
constituted over half of all COVID infections of the US.

```{r}
read.csv("data_files/covid/covid_variant_proportions.csv") %>%
  filter(modeltype == "smoothed") %>%
  group_by(week_ending,variant) %>%
  arrange(desc(published_date)) %>%
  slice(1:1) %>%
  mutate(week_ending = as.Date(substr(week_ending,1,10),format="%m/%d/%Y"),
         published_date = as.Date(substr(published_date,1,10),format="%m/%d/%Y"),
         variant = case_when(
           variant == "BA.1.1" ~ "Omicron",
           variant == "BA.2" ~ "Omicron",
           variant == "B.1.1.529" ~ "Omicron",
           variant == "BA.2.12.1" ~ "Omicron",
           variant == "B.1.1.7" ~ "Alpha",
           variant == "AY.1" ~ "Delta",
           variant == "AY.2" ~ "Delta",
           variant == "B.1.617.2" ~ "Delta",
           variant == "Other" ~ "Other")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=as.Date(week_ending),y=share,fill=variant,col=variant)) + 
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "weeks") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Georgia",size=9)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0.5) + 
  labs(x = "Date",y = "Share Infections",title = "Variant Proportions")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggsave("figures/variant_proportions.png")
```

Because of the highly contagious nature of the variant, we worried
readers might think that merely getting infected isn't a big deal given
the high share of adults infected at least once. We are also interested
in measuring the absolute amount of noxiousness and how it compares to
the pre-pandemic period, which means we need a risk measure that is
comparable to the types of workplace risk that existed prior to the
pandemic. It makes sense to think of an injury ending in death in the
same way we think about a covid infection ending in death, but comparing
a non-fatal injury such as a cut or laceration with a mild case of
covid, or a bad fracture with a case of long covid, is less
straightforward. We resolve this apples-to-apples issue by converting
the risk of a covid infection to the risk of a mild to moderate
infection or a covid hospitalization. We also calculate the risk for the
infection to result in a case of long covid. For each type of infection
severity, we can give an estimate for the number of days away from work
resulting from it by using data on the average recovery time for each
type. Finally, we use BLS data collected prior to the pandemic that
records the total number of injuries recorded in each industry and the
respective recovery times. The bottomline: if a covid infection
contracted on the job took 15 days to recover from, we argue the
severity of the infection is comparable to a workplace injury that
resulted in the worker taking 15 days away from the job.

## 2. Process Pulse data

**Creating job categories**

We start by assigning a job category to each respondent. We create job
categories by combining the type of work the respondent does and their
education level. An important point: we only keep respondents who were
18 or older at the time of being surveyed.

1.  Work in the last 7 days
    -   Variable name: any_work
    -   Phase 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4: "In the last 7 days, have you done
        any work for pay or profit?"
2.  Work outside the home
    -   Variable name: work_outside_home
    -   Phase 3.1: "Since January 1, 2021, have you worked or
        volunteered outside your home?"
    -   Phase 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4: "In the last 7 days, have you worked or
        volunteered outside your home?"
3.  Setting of work outside home
    -   Variable name: setting
    -   Phase 3.1: "Since January 1, 2021, which best describes the
        primary location/setting where you worked or volunteered outside
        your home?"
    -   Phase 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4: "In the last 7 days, which best
        describes the primary location/setting where you worked or
        volunteered outside your home?"
4.  Reason not work for pay or profit
    -   Variable name: reason_not_work
    -   Phase 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4: "What is your main reason for not
        working for pay or profit?"

**Categorization**

-   In-person workers
    -   Has worked in the last 7 days (any_work = 1)
    -   Worked or volunteered outside the home (work_outside_home = 1)
-   Remote workers
    -   Has worked in the last 7 days (any_work = 1)
    -   Has not worked or volunteered outside the home
        (work_outside_home = 2)
-   Unemployed
    -   Has not worked in the last 7 days (any_work = 2)
    -   Main reason for not working for pay or profit:
        -   Was concerned about getting or spreading the coronavirus
            (reason_not_work = 5)
        -   Was laid off or furloughed due to coronavirus pandemic
            (reason_not_work = 8)
        -   Employer closed temporarily due to coronavirus pandemic
            (reason_not_work = 9)
        -   Employer went out of business due to coronavirus pandemic
            (reason_not_work = 10)
        -   I do/did not have transportation to work (reason_not_work =
            11)
-   NILF
    -   Has not worked in the last 7 days (any_work = 2)
    -   Main reason for not working for pay or profit:
        -   I did not want to be employed at this time (reason_not_work
            = 1)
        -   I am/was sick with coronavirus symptoms or caring for
            someone who was sick with coronavirus symptoms
            (reason_not_work = 2)
        -   I am/was caring for children not in school or daycare
            (reason_not_work = 3)
        -   I am/was caring for an elderly person (reason_not_work = 4)
        -   I am/was sick (not coronavirus related) or disabled
            (reason_not_work = 6)
        -   I am retired (reason_not_work = 7)
        -   Other reason, please specify (reason_not_work = 12)

**Education Levels** We create 4 education categories:

1.  Less than high school graduate
2.  High school graduate or GED
3.  Some college or associate's degree
4.  Bachelor's degree or higher

**Combining education and setting data**

For the categories, "Working from home", "Unemployed", and "NILF", we
collapse across all 4 education categories as the type of work and
riskiness of it should not vary in these categories. Due to the
relatively small size of some of these job categories, we also make the
following changes to our job categories:

1.  Combine the "less than high school" and "high school" categories for
    "correctional facilities".
2.  Combine the 4 "health care" and 4 "death care" categories into 4
    "health and death care" categories.
3.  Combine the "less than high school" and "high school" categories for
    public transit.
4.  Combine the "less than high school" and "high school" categories for
    USPS.

We arrive at a final list of 60 job categories.

          select(-phase) %>%
          dplyr::rename({{x}} := oldvar),all.x = TRUE)
  return(df)
}
```

Clean up data steps:

-   Removed respondents born after 2003
-   Removed respondents missing responses necessary for categorization
    (vaccine status, whether they work outside the home, reason for not
    working)
-   Categorizing remote workers, nilf, and unemployed
-   Recoding variables from numbers to text

```{r}
clean <- function(df, phase){
 nilf <- c(1,2,3,4,6,7,12)
 df <- df %>% 
  filter(birth_year <= 2003 & work_outside_home > 0 & setting != -99 & reason_not_work != -99) %>%
  mutate(setting = case_when(
    work_outside_home == 2 & any_work == 1 ~ 20,
    any_work == 2 & !(reason_not_work %in% nilf) ~ 21,
    any_work == 2 & reason_not_work %in% nilf ~ 22,
    TRUE ~ setting)) %>%
  filter(setting > 0) %>%
  mutate(race_ethnicity = if_else(hisp_ethnicity == 2,5,race)) %>%
  left_join(unique(get(data("fips_codes")) %>%

```

Merge all phases and export:

```{r}
pulse <- rbind(phase3.1,
               phase3.2,
               phase3.3,
               phase3.4)
```


#### Sanity checking telework

Doing a sanity check the latter phases, "In the last 7 days, have you or
your household done any of the following... Teleworked or worked from
home?" we find that 34% of our "WFH" employees said they didn't work
from home.

To handle these "inconsistent" responses, we treat it as missing impute
these settings by using a respondent's age, education level, household
income, etc. to predict the missing setting.

```{r}
temp_merge <- rbind(phase3.2,phase3.3,phase3.4)
temp_merge %>%
  filter(setting == "working from home" & teleworked > 0) %>%
  mutate(teleworked = if_else(teleworked == 1,"Yes","No")) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(teleworked) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent_teleworked = count/sum(count)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=teleworked,
             y=percent_teleworked)) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x="In the last 7 days, have you or your household teleworked?",
       y="% of work from home respondents",
       title = "Inconsisent categorization",
       subtitle = "Respondents who indicated they worked but didn't work in-person or at home") + 
  geom_col(color = "black",
           fill="slategray3",
           size=0.4,
           width=0.6) +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(percent_teleworked,2)), 
            position=position_dodge(width=0.9), 
            vjust=-0.5) +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Georgia",
                            size=9))
```

```{r}
ggsave("figures/inconsisent_responses.png")
```

```{r}
temp_merge <- temp_merge %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(setting = as.character(setting),
                setting = if_else((setting == "working from home" & teleworked == 2),
                                  "missing",
                                  setting)) %>%
  replace_with_na(replace = list(setting = "missing"))
```

```{r}
pulse_grouped <- temp_merge %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor) %>%
  rbind(.,phase3.1)
```


```{r}
write.csv(pulse_grouped,"data_files/pulse/processed/all_phases.csv")
```

Using missForest (random forest algorithm implementation) to impute
missing values. (Note: this takes hours to run so I just have the task running on the Stanford clusuters and will update once it finishes)

```{r}
#imputed <- missForest(pulse_grouped %>% select(-job))
```


## 3. Relative Risk

### 3.1. Estimate hours in each setting

Having categorized Pulse respondents into their respective work
categories, we now want to create a model to estimate the relative covid
risk for different workers. Because we are ultimately interested in
understanding risk specific to the workplace, we want to distribute
infections between those occurring at work, leisure, or at home. To do
this, we take the following steps:

Under the assumption that spending more time in a certain setting
increases ones probability of contracting covid in it, we first go about
estimating the number of hours a respondent spends at home, leisure, and
the workplace. To do this, we use pooled state-level ATUS data and
determine the average number of hours respondents in each work status
(NILF, unemployed, employed remote, employed in-person) spend in the
three settings.

The first step is to prepare the ATUS data, categorizing respondents
into the work statuses of interest.

#### 3.1.1. Processing ATUS data:

-   Respondent file contains information on labor status obtained from
    CPS. We use this to categorize as we do CPS data.
    -   emp_status: 1 = Employed, at work. 2 = Employed, absent. 3 =
        Unemployed, on layoff. 4 = Unemployed, looking. 5 = Not in labor
        force.
    -   industry: census industry codes
    -   occupation: census occupation codes

```{r}
clean_vars <- read.csv("data_files/cleanvariables/atus/atus_cleanvars.csv")
cic_to_pulse <- read.csv("data_files/cps_acs/crosswalk/cic_to_pulse.csv")
coc_to_pulse <- read.csv("data_files/cps_acs/crosswalk/coc_to_pulse.csv")
teleworkable <- read.csv("data_files/cps_acs/crosswalk/teleworkable.csv")
```

```{r}
open <- function(yr,tp){
  filepath = paste0("data_files/atus/",yr,"/atus",tp,"_",yr,".dat")
  clean <- clean_vars %>% filter(type == tp & year == yr)
  df <- read.delim(filepath, header=TRUE, sep=",") %>%
    dplyr::select(clean$atusname) %>%
    purrr::set_names(clean$newname) %>%
    mutate(year = yr)
  return(df)
}
```

```{r}
atusresp <- rbind(open("2020","resp"),
                  open("2021","resp"))
```

We obtain job categories for all ATUS respondents using our CPS
crosswalk which matches Census industries and occupations to one of our
Pulse settings. As we do in the ATUS, we only categorize a respondent as
employed if they've done work for pay or profit in the last 7 days.
Workers who aren't employed are categorized as NILF if their reason for
not working is that they are retired, disabled, or unable to work.

```{r}
atusresp <- atusresp %>% 
  merge(.,cic_to_pulse,by="industry") %>%
  merge(., coc_to_pulse,by=c("occupation","industry","industry_title"),all.x=TRUE) %>%
  merge(.,teleworkable,by = "occupation",all.x=TRUE) %>%
  mutate(teleworkable = ifelse(is.na(teleworkable),0,teleworkable),
         setting = coalesce(occupation_based_setting,industry_based_setting)) %>% 
  mutate(setting = as.character(setting),
         casied = as.character(caseid)) %>%
  mutate(setting = ifelse(any_work == 2,"Unemployed",
                          ifelse(any_work %in% c(3,4,5),"NILF",setting)))
```

Now we get atus-cps file which contains information on the state and
education level of respondents.

```{r}
#Convert fips codes into state names
fips <- unique(get(data("fips_codes")) %>% 
              select(state_code,state_name) %>% 
              dplyr::rename("state" = "state_code") %>%
              mutate(state = as.numeric(state)))
```

```{r}
atuscps <- rbind(open("2020","cps"),
                 open("2021","cps"))
```

```{r}
# Education variable into our four categories
atuscps <- atuscps %>%
  # File contains responses for household members as well. We filter for atus_respondent = 1, corresponding to person interviewed for ATUS
  filter(atus_respondent == 1) %>%
  merge(.,fips,by="state") %>%
  mutate(state = state_name) %>%
  select(-state_name) %>%
  mutate(caseid = as.character(caseid)) %>%
  mutate(education = case_when(
    education <= 38 ~ "Less than HS graduate",
    education == 39 ~ "HS graduate or GED",
    education > 39 & education <= 42 ~ "Some college or associate's degree",
    education > 42 & education <= 46 ~ "Bachelor's degree or higher"
  ))
```

```{r}
#Merge with respondent file for a complete view:
atusresp <- merge(atusresp %>% mutate(caseid = as.character(caseid)),
                  atuscps %>% mutate(caseid = as.character(caseid)),
                  by=c("caseid","year"))
```

Finally, we can merge with activity data to get time distribution across
settings. ATUS activity file includes activity-level information
collected in ATUS, including activity code, location, duration, activity
start and stop times.

```{r}
#Note, two different variables available for the cumulative duration of an activity. In the one we use, the last activity is truncated at 4 am.
atusact <- rbind(open("2020","act"),
                 open("2021","act"))
```

Location is not collected for activities with activity codes of 0101xx
(sleeping), 0102xx (grooming), 0104xx (personal activites), 500105 (none
of your business), or 500106 (gap can't remember). We assume sleeping,
grooming, and personal activities occured in the household. Finally, we
remove location code 89, "Unspecified place".

```{r}
atusact <- atusact %>%
  mutate(location = ifelse(tier1code == 1 & tier2code %in% c(1,2,3),1,location)) %>%
  filter(location != -1 & location != 89) %>%
  mutate(caseid = as.character(caseid)) %>%
  merge(.,atusresp,by=c("caseid","year"))
```

#### 3.1.2. Categorizing in-person and remote workers

Currently, we categorize workers based on their industry and occupation,
but do not specify whether they are remote or in-person. The CPS added a
question on whether the respondent did any teleworking:

*"At any time in the LAST 4 WEEKS, did (you/name) telework or work at
home for pay BECAUSE OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC?*

However, this captures a different set of people than the Pulse, which
asks:

*"Since January 1, 2021 [or "In the last 7 days" for later surveys],
have you worked or volunteered outside your home?"*

Three main differences with the question:

1.  In the Pulse, we categorize anyone who worked outside the home at
    any point as in-person. In the CPS, anyone who worked remotely is
    remote. E.g., If person X worked 3 days at home and 2 days in-person
    because of covid policied, they'd be remote in the CPS but in-person
    in the Pulse.
2.  The timeframe for the CPS is the last 4 weeks while the Pulse asks
    about the last 7 days (for most phases)
3.  The CPS only captures those who teleworked *because* of covid.

Because of all the discrepancies, using data from the ATUS itself could
be a better stratey to replicate the Pulse question. As a first step we:

-   Get all respondents who did work in the last 7 days (i.e., those we
    label as "employed" in the Pulse)
-   From the hours these respondents spent working, calculate how many
    were in the workplace.
-   If a respondent spent *any* time in the workplace, they are
    categorized as in-person.
-   If a respondent spent no time in the workplace, they are categorized
    as remote.

Why look specifically at the workplace instead of just checking whether
the time was spent outside the home? I was worried that a lot of remote
workers might spend time working in libraries, coffeeshops, friends
houses, trains (while commuting somewhere), etc. Although the Pulse
survey only asks if they've worked "outside the home", the question is
really asking if they've done in-person work at a workplace setting
(hence why the follow-up question asks about the setting). In other
words, if a Pulse respondent works remotely at a coffeeshop, they would
still be remote for Pulse standards. Thus, determining whether an ATUS
respondent spent work time at a workplace was a better way of getting at
the in-person Pulse population.

An issue with this strategy is that some respondents did no work on the
day they were surveyed (were surveyed on the weekend, etc). For cases
where we have no ATUS information, we move on the next "best" data, the
CPS question asking if they were remotely. Those who said they
teleworked are categorized as remote, those that didn't are in-person.

Finally, due to the non-response rate to the teleworking question on the
CPS, as a last resort, we use the Dingel and Neiman categorizations to
know if the respondent's job is teleworkable or not.

```{r}
cats <- atusact %>%
  filter(tier1code == 5 & tier2code == 1 & tier3code == 1) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(top_location = ifelse(location == 2,"Workplace","Other")) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(caseid,top_location) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(work_time = sum(duration)) %>%

#### 3.1.3. Assess crosswalk

To assess our crosswalk, we can compare the estimated population of
remote workers from the Pulse and the ATUS.

First, we can convert Pulse weeks into months. To keep it simple, I'm
categorizing each week based on the month the majority of days fall
into. If multiple weeks fall in the same month, I take the average of
each week's estimates.

Week 28: April 14 - April 26 Week 29: April 28 - May 10 Week 30: May
12 - May 24 Week 31: May 26 - June 7 Week 32: June 9 - June 21 Week 33:
June 23 - July 5 Week 34: July 21 - August 2 Week 35: August 4 - August
16 Week 36: August 18 - August 30 Week 37: September 1 - September 13
Week 38: September 15 - September 27 Week 39: September 29 - October 11

```{r}
pulse <- read.csv("data_files/pulse/processed/all_phases.csv")
```


```{r}
wfh_est <- pulse %>%
  select(week,job,setting,weight) %>%
  mutate(month = case_when(
    week == 28 ~ 4,
    week == 29 ~ 4,
    week == 30 ~ 5,
    week == 31 ~ 5,
    week == 32 ~ 6,
    week == 33 ~ 6,
    week == 34 ~ 7,
    week == 35 ~ 8,
    week == 36 ~ 8,
    week == 37 ~ 9,
    week == 38 ~ 9,
    week == 39 ~ 10
  )) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  filter(!(job %in% c("Unemployed","NILF"))) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(month,week,setting) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(total = sum(weight)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(percent = total/sum(total)) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(month,setting) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(percent = mean(percent)) %>%
  filter(setting == "working from home") %>%
  select(percent) %>%
  mutate(type = "Pulse")
```


```{r}
wfh_est <- rbind(wfh_est,atusact %>%
  filter(month %in% c(4,5,6,7,8,9,10) & year == 2021 & top_category %in% c("In-person","Remote")) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(month,top_category) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(total = sum(weight)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(percent = total/sum(total)) %>%
  filter(top_category == "Remote") %>%
  select(percent) %>%
  mutate(type = "ATUS"))
```

We can estimate the percent of the population made up by remote workers:

```{r}
wfh_est %>%
  spread(type,percent) %>%
  kable()
```

Our estimate for the ATUS is lower, although the difference is small and
remains somewhat consistent across the months. I would love to know what
you think about it!

```{r}
wfh_est %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=month,y=percent,color=type)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x="Month",y="% labor force",title = "Remote employee estimate - ATUS vs. Pulse") + 
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Georgia",size=11)) + 
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Focus of chapter") +
  scale_color_manual(values=wes_palette(n=2, name="Zissou1",type="continuous"))
```

Calculating the correlation between the estimates:

```{r}
cor(wfh_est[wfh_est$type == "ATUS",]$percent,wfh_est[wfh_est$type == "Pulse",]$percent)
```

#### 3.1.4. Calculate time in each setting

Having obtained a crosswalk between the ATUS and work categories of
interest, we can now estimate the percent of time each group spent at
home, at work, and outside the home and workplace ("leisure"). Before
this calculation, a question I want to run by you:

In the Pulse and ATUS, a respondent who does any in-person work will be
categorized as "in-person" even if they spend time working at home. This
means many of our "in-person" workers will really be *hybrid* workers
who do some of their work at home or in "remote workplaces" (eg.
coffeeshop). Similarly, in-person workers will spend some work hours
outside the home (though not in the workplace). Because our infection
proportions are based on settings (home, workplace, leisure (outside
home and outside workplace)), we will calculate the average hours in
each setting, but when we *divide* infections, we will have to consider
time spent working in each setting.

To give a simple example:

-   Remote workers had 10 infections
-   Remote workers spent 50% of time at home and 50% time outside the
    home (not at the workplace). We attribute 5 infections to each
    setting.
-   From time at home, 20% was spent working. From time outside home,
    40% of time was spent working. We attribute 3 infections to work.

As a first step, we can calculate time spent in each setting:

```{r}
atusact <- atusact %>%
  mutate(top_location = case_when(
    location == 1 ~ "Home",
    location == 2 & top_category == "In-person" ~ "Workplace",
    TRUE ~ "Leisure"
  )) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(date = as.yearmon(paste(year,month), "%Y %m")) 

time_per_setting <- atusact %>%
  filter(date > "Mar 2020") %>%
  dplyr::group_by(top_location,top_category,caseid,weight) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(time = sum(duration)/60) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  complete(nesting(caseid,weight,top_category),top_location,fill=list(time=0)) %>%
  group_by(top_location,top_category) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(time = weighted.mean(time,weight)) 

time_per_setting %>%
  filter(time > 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=top_category,y=time,fill=top_location)) + 
  geom_col(position = position_stack(reverse = TRUE),size=0.3,width=0.5,color = "black") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x="Group",y="Avg. number of hours",title = "Time in each setting by group") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) + 
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Georgia",size=12)) +
  scale_fill_manual(name="Setting",values=wes_palette(n=3, name="FantasticFox1",type="continuous"))
```

Exporting time-per-setting:

```{r}
write.csv(time_per_setting,"data_files/atus/time_per_setting.csv")
```

Now, we can merge our Pulse data with information on time per setting:

```{r}
# Convert Pulse settings into 4 categories (in-person, nilf, remote, unemployed)
pulse <- pulse %>%
  mutate(top_category = case_when(
    setting == "nilf" ~ "NILF",
    setting == "unemployed" ~ "Unemployed",
    setting == "working from home" ~ "Remote",
    TRUE ~ "In-person"
  ))
```

```{r}
# Spread time per setting data for easier merging
time_per_setting <- time_per_setting %>%
  mutate(top_location = paste0("Time_At_",top_location)) %>%
  spread(top_location,time)
  
# Merge data
pulse <- pulse %>%
  merge(.,time_per_setting,by="top_category")
```

#### 3.1.5. Sanity check time in each setting

Because we are averaging time in each setting from across the pandemic
period, we risk over or underestimating the number of infections
occuring in a given setting. If, for example, the time spent during
leisure increased significantly in the last two months we study, our
leisure hour average will underestimate leisure time in those two months
and result in an underestimate of infections. The upshot: for our
procedure to be accurate, we would want the percent of time spent in
each setting to remain consistent. With this in mind, we looked at ATUS
data from April 2020 to December 2021 to look at time spent in each
setting per month:

```{r}
time_date <- atusact %>%
  filter(date > "Mar 2020") %>%
  dplyr::group_by(date,top_location,top_category,caseid,weight) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(time = sum(duration)/60) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  complete(nesting(date,caseid,weight,top_category),top_location,fill=list(time=0)) %>%
  group_by(date,top_location,top_category) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(time = weighted.mean(time,weight)) %>%
  filter(time > 0)

time_date %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date,y=time,color=top_location)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~top_category) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x="Date",y="Avg. number of hours",title = "Time in each setting by group") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1)) + 
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Georgia",size=12)) +
  scale_color_manual(name="Setting",values=wes_palette(n=3, name="FantasticFox1",type="continuous")) 
```

Visually, the hours seem stable to me, but I'd love to get your
thoughts. Looking at the variance of these monthly averages:

```{r}
time_date %>%
  dplyr::group_by(top_category,top_location) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(variance = var(time)) %>%
  kable()
```

Exporting Pulse data with time per setting:

```{r}
write.csv(pulse,"data_files/pulse/processed/pulse_with_time.csv")
```


### 3.2. Idenitifying risk-takers and risk-averse respondents

#### 3.2.1. YouGov data overview

Next, because the risk of an hour spent in a setting depends on whether
respondents practice preventive behaviors, we obtain an estimate of
whether the respondent is a risk-taker or is risk-averse.

While the Pulse does not contain data on respondents' preventative
behavior, it does contain questions on their beliefs about COVID-19
vaccines which have been shown to be correlated with preventive-behavior
habits. For example, a KFF report finds that unvaccinated adults "are
more likely to say they are not worried they personally will get
seriously sick from the coronavirus" and were much less likely than
vaccinated adults to report that the Delta variant made them more likely
to wear a mask or avoid large gatherings. Thus, we create the following
prediction model using relevant variables available in both the YouGov
and Pulse surveys:

DISCUSSION ABOUT RISK IN THE WORKPLACE ETC

The YouGov survey contains the following relevant variables for risky
behavior during leisure:

"Thinking about the last 7 days... how often have you taken the
following measures to protect yourself or others from coronavirus? As a
reminder, please exclude any measures that you have already taken for
reasons other than coronavirus."

1.  **washed_hands:** "...Washed hands with soap and water"
2.  **hand_sanitizer:** "...Used hand sanitiser"
3.  **avoid_contact_covid:** "...Avoided contact with people who have
    symptoms or you think may have been exposed to the coronavirus"
4.  **avoid_public_transit:** "...Avoided taking public transport"
5.  **avoid_guests:** "...Avoided having guests to your home"
6.  **avoid_gatherings_small:** "...Avoided small social gatherings (not
    more than 2 people)"
7.  **avoid_gatherings_medium:** "...Avoided medium-sized social
    gatherings (between 3 and 10 people)"
8.  **avoid_gatherings_large:** "...Avoided large-sized social
    gatherings (more than 10 people)"
9.  **avoid_shops:** "...Avoided going to shops"
10. **avoid_public_events:** "...Avoided attending public events, such
    as sports matches, festivals, theatres, clubs, or going to religious
    services"
11. **avoid_hh_indoors:** "...Avoided mixing with other households
    indoors"
12. **maskgrocery:** "...Worn a face mask inside a grocery store /
    supermarket"
13. **maskclotheshop:** "...Worn a face mask inside a clothing /
    footwear shop"
14. **masktransit:** "...Worn a face mask on public transportation"

Our current method uses the last three variables (maskgrocery,
maskclotheshop, and masktransit) to categorize respondents as risky or
not risky. We want to make sure our measure of risky behavior pertains
exclusively to the leisure setting, so we excluded the question
*1.Thinking about the last 7 days, how often have you worn a face mask
at your place of work?*. However, it is still possible that questions
2-4 are contaminated by work-specific behavior if the respondent works
in these settings (grocery store, footwear shop, etc). To get around
this issue, we identify workers who are likely to work in these
locations based on the job they indicated on the survey and treat their
answer to the respective location question as missing, imputing it on
the basis of other responses.

The following answer choices are available for these questions:

-   Always
-   Frequently
-   Sometimes
-   Rarely
-   Not at all

Ideally, if someone rarely or does not at all wear a mask in these
settings, we would know they are risk-takers. However, we are concerned
that someone might select these options because they haven't been to the
setting. To give an example, if someone says they haven't at all worn a
mask in public transport we want to know if this is because they are
risky or because they simply haven't been on public transport. To figure
this out, we use the question: *"Thinking about the last 7 days... how
often have you [avoided taking public transport] to protect yourself or
others from coronavirus? As a reminder, please exclude any measures that
you have already taken for reasons other than coronavirus."*

Our goal is to use this question to figure out if someone has taken
public transport the last 7 days. If we think they have, then they must
indicate to have worn a mask at least some of the time. However, if they
have not, then their mask-wearing behavior in the setting becomes
irrelevant.

Responses 'always' and 'not at all' seem to me as the most
straight-forward to interpret:

-   Always
    -   Person who has not taken public transport because they are being
        covid-cautious. This person would be considered risk-averse,
        -   One issue you raised was that someone might "avoid" public
            transport for reasons other than covid (e.g., they have a
            car and drive everywhere) so they might *not* actually be
            risk averse even if they're never in the setting. Yet, I
            think the way the question is asked helps us avoid the
            problem by explicitly asking respondents to "exclude any
            measures that you have already taken for reasons other than
            coronavirus". So, if someone does not take public transport
            because they have a car, their response to the question
            "Avoided taking public transport" would be "not at all".
-   Not at all
    -   Person who has taken public transport with the same frequency as
        they would regardless of covid. This could mean:
        -   They haven't taken any public transport for other reasons
            (e.g., they have a car)
        -   They have taken public transport as they normally would

The responses "Frequently", "Sometimes", and "Rarely" are harder to
interpret. The most straightforward example:

-   Person who used to take the bus every single day but reduced their
    bus rides because of covid concerns. They didn't reduce bus rides
    fully or else they would have said "Always" so we know they spent at
    least some time on the bus.
    -   For example, person X used to take the bus to work 5 days a
        week, but due to covid concerns they were able to get a ride
        with a friend for 4 out of the 5 days. Because they spent *some*
        time on the bus, we would expect them to have worn a mask.

But the question is, do we also believe this slightly more convoluted
example:

-   Person who never used the bus this week but only some of the times
    due to covid concerns
    -   For example, person X was going to take the bus on Wednesday,
        but the bus was delayed and person X was forced to walk. On
        Thursday, person X was going to ride the bus, but they got
        nervous about covid and decided to walk instead.

I honestly don't feel super worried about this kind of example. In
general, my sense is that:

-   someone who says they 'frequently', 'sometimes', or 'rarely' avoided
    taking public transport are people who spent at least some time on
    the bus.
-   someone who says they 'always' avoided taking public transport did
    not spend any time on the bus because they were worried about covid
-   someone who did 'not at all' avoid taking public transport might
    have spent a lot of time on public transport or spent no time on it
    for reasons other than covid concerns
    -   this makes it the least informative response because we don't
        know what to expect for mask behavior, and we don't know whether
        they are risk-takers or not

Thus, for each setting we have three possibilities:

-   Risk-averse: If they "Always", "Frequently", or "Sometimes" wear a
    mask and/or they "Always" avoided the setting
-   Risk-taker: If they "Frequently", "Sometimes", or "Rarely" avoid the
    setting and "rarely" or "not at all" wear a mask
-   Unknown: If they "Not at all" avoided the setting and "rarely" or
    "not at all" wear a mask

Now we want to know:

1.  How do we categorize those "unknown" respondents?
2.  Once we have risk-level for each setting, how do we categorize the
    respondent overall? If they are risky in one setting? If they are
    risky in two settings? Etc.

To do this, I checked the different permutations of risk by setting with
the average of the following variables (where always = 5 and not at all
= 1)

1.  washed_hands: "...Washed hands with soap and water"
2.  hand_sanitizer: "...Used hand sanitiser"
3.  avoid_contact_covid: "...Avoided contact with people who have
    symptoms or you think may have been exposed to the coronavirus"
4.  avoid_guests: "...Avoided having guests to your home"
5.  avoid_gatherings_small: "...Avoided small social gatherings (not
    more than 2 people)"
6.  avoid_gatherings_medium: "...Avoided medium-sized social gatherings
    (between 3 and 10 people)"
7.  avoid_gatherings_large: "...Avoided large-sized social gatherings
    (more than 10 people)"
8.  avoid_public_events: "...Avoided attending public events, such as
    sports matches, festivals, theatres, clubs, or going to religious
    services"
9.  avoid_hh_indoors: "...Avoided mixing with other households indoors"

                   total = n()) %>%
  arrange(risky_avg) %>%
  kable()
```

Looking at the data, my instinct would be to recategorize "Unknown" as
risky for each setting. Then, I would categorize any respondents with
two or more risky settings as risky overall (eg, choose based on
majority). Doing this we obtain the following totals:

```{r}
yougov <- yougov %>% 
  mutate_all(as.character) %>%
  mutate(risky_shop = ifelse(risky_shop == "-1","1",risky_shop),
         risky_grocery = ifelse(risky_grocery == "-1","1",risky_grocery),
         risky_transport = ifelse(risky_transport == "-1","1",risky_transport)) %>%
  mutate(is_risky = ifelse(as.numeric(risky_shop) + as.numeric(risky_grocery) + as.numeric(risky_transport) >= 2,1,0))
```

#### 3.2.2. Risky behavior sanity checks

Now, looking at different behaviors by group:

```{r}
yougov_2 <- yougov %>% 
  select(avoid_contact_covid,
       avoid_gatherings_small,
       avoid_gatherings_medium,

       washed_hands,
       risky_shop,
       risky_grocery,
       risky_transport,
       is_risky) %>%
  gather(behavior,frequency,-risky_shop,-risky_grocery,-risky_transport,-is_risky) %>%
  filter(frequency != " ") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(is_risky = as.factor(is_risky),
                frequency = factor(frequency,
                                   levels = c("Not at all","Rarely","Sometimes","Frequently","Always"))) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(is_risky,behavior,frequency) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(count = n()) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(total = sum(count),
                percent = count / total,
                is_risky = ifelse(is_risky == 1,"Risk-taker","Risk-averse"))
yougov_2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=frequency,y=percent,fill=is_risky)) + 
  geom_col(position = 'dodge') + 
  facet_wrap(~behavior) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x="Frequency",y="% of group",title = "Behavior by group") + 
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Georgia",size=9)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) + 
  scale_fill_brewer("Riskiness",palette="Set2")
```

Collapsing to look at averages where "Always" = 5 and "Not at all" = 1

```{r}
yougov_2 %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(frequency = case_when(
                  frequency == "Always" ~ 5,
                  frequency == "Frequently" ~ 4,
                  frequency == "Sometimes" ~ 3,
                  frequency == "Rarely" ~ 2,
                  frequency == "Not at all" ~ 1),
                sum = percent * frequency) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(is_risky,behavior) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(score = sum(sum)) %>%
  spread(is_risky,score) %>%
  kable()
```

```{r}
count(yougov$frequency)
```

```{r}
yougov %>%
  mutate(is_risky = ifelse(is_risky==0,"Not Risky","Risky")) %>%

[TALK ABOUT DEFINING RISK AVERSE VS RISK TAKER]

We estimate that around 80% of Americans were risk-averse during the
time of the survey. To sanity check our estimate, we use a different
survey conducted by the NYTimes on mask wearing behavior, obtaining a
similar result:

```{r}
nytimes <- read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/mask-use/mask-use-by-county.csv"))
```

```{r}
pops <- get(data("county_census")) %>% 
  dplyr::rename("COUNTYFP" = "FIPS") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(COUNTYFP = as.numeric(COUNTYFP)) %>%
  select(COUNTYFP,POPESTIMATE2019)
```

```{r}
merge(nytimes,pops,by="COUNTYFP") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(risk_averse = FREQUENTLY + ALWAYS,
                risk_taker = NEVER + RARELY + SOMETIMES) %>%
  dplyr::summarise('Risk Averse %' = weighted.mean(risk_averse,POPESTIMATE2019,na.rm=TRUE),
                   'Risk Taker %' = weighted.mean(risk_taker,POPESTIMATE2019,na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  kable()
```

#### 3.2.3. Risky behavior model

Having categorized YouGov respondents as risk-averse or risk-takers, we
can create a prediction model using variables also available in the
Pulse relating to whether a person is vaccinated or not, if they want to
be vaccinated, and their general beliefs about the vaccine, and
government/health authorities:

-   isvax: Have you had the first or second doses of a Coronavirus
    (COVID-19) vaccine?
    -   0 = "No, neither"
    -   1 = "Yes, one dose" OR "Yes, two doses"
-   wantsvax: If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week,
    I would definitely get it
    -   0 = 2, 3, 4, 5 (where 5 = strongly disagree)
    -   1 = 1 (where 1 = strongly agree)
-   gov_skeptic: I believe government health authorities in my country
    will provide me with an effective COVID19 vaccine
    -   0 = 1, 2, 3 (where 1 = strongly agree)
    -   1 = 4, 5 (where 5 = strongly disagree)
-   test_concerns: I have concerns there has not been enough testing of
    vaccines
    -   0 = No
    -   1 = Yes
-   mistrustvax: How much do you trust COVID-19 vaccines?
    -   0 = 1, 2, 3 (where 1 = very much)
    -   1 = 4, 5 (where 5 = not at all)
-   side_effects: I have concerns about side effects
    -   0 = No
    -   1 = Yes
-   gen_vac_skeptic: I don't think a vaccine would be effective enough
    -   0 = No
    -   1 = Yes

**YouGov to Pulse vaccine variables**

| YouGov Var Name | YouGov Description                                                                                      | Pulse Description                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| wantsvax        | If a Covid-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it                    | Once a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is available to you, would you |
| gov_skeptic     | I believe government health authorities in my country will provide me with an effective COVID19 vaccine | I don't trust the government                                      |

| mistrustvax     | How much do you trust COVID-19 vaccines?                                                                | I don't trust COVID-19 vaccines                                   |
| side_effects    | I have concerns about side effects                                                                      | I am concerned about possible side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine  |
| gen_vac_skeptic | I don't think a vaccine would be effective enough                                                       | I don't think vaccines are beneficial                             |

**Notes on relevant Pulse variables**

All Pulse phases contain the following question: \* **isvax:** Have you
received a COVID-19 vaccine + 1 = Yes + 2 = No

If respondents say they've received the vaccine, they answer the
follow-up question (variable = **all_doses**):

-   Phase 3.1: Did you receive (or do you plan to receive) all required
    doses
    -   1 = Yes
    -   2 = No
    -   -99 = Did not respond
-   Phase 3.2: Did you receive (or do you plan to receive) all required
    doses
    -   1 = Yes, received all doses
    -   2 = Yes, plan to receive all required doses
    -   3 = No, don't plan to receive all required doses
    -   -99 = Did not respond
-   Phase 3.3 and 3.4: How many dose(s) of a COVID-19 vaccine have you
    received
    -   1 = 1 vaccination
    -   2 = 2 vaccinations
    -   3 = 3 vaccinations
    -   4 = 4 or more vaccinations
    -   5 = Don't know
    -   -99 = Did not respond

If respondents *haven't* received the vaccine (isvax == No), all Pulse
phases answer the follow-up question: \* **wantsvax:** Once a vaccine to
prevent COVID-19 is available to you, would you... + 1 = Definitely get
a vaccine + 2 = Probably get a vaccine + 3 = Be unsure about getting a
vaccine + 4 = Probably NOT get a vaccine + 5 = Definitely NOT get a
vaccine + -99 - Did not respond

The questions we use to obtain our predictors (gov_skeptic,
mistrust_vax, side_effects) are only asked if:

-   Phase 3.1 and 3.2: Person has not received all doses (i.e., isvax ==
    No or all_doses == No) and they *did not* say they'd definitely get
    a vaccine (wantsvax != 1)
-   Phase 3.3 and 3.4: Person has not received the vaccine (isvax ==
    No), regardless of doses, and they do not definitely want the
    vaccine (wantsvax != 1)

In line with this, we set our relevant variables as follows:

-   isvax
    -   Phase 3.1 and 3.2: Yes if received or planned to received all
        required doses
    -   Phase 3.3 and 3.4: Yes if received a vaccine
-   wantsvax
    -   All phases: Yes if haven't received a vaccine but will
        definitely get a vaccine
-   mistrust_vax, gov_skeptic, side_effects: Can only be set to "Yes" if
    person hasn't received a vaccine and doesn't want to
-   other: Set to "Yes" if person doesn't want vaccine but for reasons
    outside of those in these variables

We follow this same logic when setting YouGov variables:

-   wantsvax is only set to "Yes" if person "Strongly agrees" that
    they'd definitely get the vaccine
-   variables gov_skeptic, mistrust_vax, side_effects, and other are
    automatically set to "No" if person wants vaccine

```{r}
yougov <- yougov %>% 
  filter(date > "2021-04-06") %>%
  dplyr::filter(isvax != " ") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(wantsvax = substr(wantsvax,1,1)) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(isvax = ifelse(isvax %in% c("Yes, one dose","Yes, two doses"),"Yes","No")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(wantsvax = ifelse(wantsvax %in% c(1,2) & isvax == "No","Yes","No")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(gov_skeptic = substr(gov_skeptic,1,1)) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(gov_skeptic = ifelse(gov_skeptic %in% c("4","5"),"Yes","No")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(mistrust_vax = ifelse(mistrust_vax %in% c("A little","Not at all"),"Yes","No")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(side_effects = as.character(side_effects)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(side_effects = ifelse(side_effects == "Yes","Yes","No"))
```

```{r}
yg <- yougov %>%
  mutate(vax = case_when(
    isvax == "Yes" ~ "IsVax",
    wantsvax == "Yes" ~ "WantsVax",
    TRUE ~ "NoVax"
  )) %>%
  mutate(have_info = ifelse(vax == "NoVax",0,1))
```

#### 3.2.4. Running prediction models

```{r}
risky_model<- glm(is_risky ~
                    vax +
                    mistrust_vax + 
                    gov_skeptic +
                    side_effects,
                    yg,
                    family = "binomial")
summary(risky_model)
save(risky_model, file = "data_files/models/yougov_risky_behavior.rda")
```

Now, we can apply the model to the Pulse data to make predictions.
First, we recode Pulse data to match the model's input:

```{r}
pulse <- read.csv("data_files/pulse/processed/pulse_with_time.csv")
```


```{r}
pulse <- pulse %>%
  mutate(alldoses = ifelse(isvax == "No","No",as.character(alldoses))) %>%
  mutate(isvax = ifelse(isvax == "Yes" & alldoses != "No","Yes","No")) %>%
  mutate(wantsvax = ifelse(wantsvax == "Yes","Yes","No")) %>%
  mutate(gov_skeptic = ifelse(gov_skeptic == 1,"Yes","No")) %>%
  mutate(side_effects = ifelse(side_effects == 1,"Yes","No")) %>%
  mutate(mistrust_vax = ifelse(mistrust_vax == 1,"Yes","No"))
```

```{r}
pulse <- pulse %>%
  mutate(vax = case_when(
    isvax == "Yes" ~ "IsVax",
    wantsvax == "Yes" ~ "WantsVax",
    TRUE ~ "NoVax"
  ))
```

Let's add age, state, education level

```{r}
load(file="data_files/models/yougov_risky_behavior.rda")
```

```{r}
preds <- predict(risky_model,pulse,type="response")
pulse$risky_pred <- preds
```

For now, let's assume that anyone with more than a 25% of being risky is
risky:

```{r}
pulse %>%
  dplyr::group_by(vax,gov_skeptic,side_effects,mistrust_vax,risky_pred) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(count=sum(weight)) %>%
  arrange(-risky_pred) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(percent_of_pop = count/sum(count)) %>%
  select(-count)
```

```{r}
pulse$is_risky <- ifelse(pulse$risky_pred > 0.25, 1, 0)
```

We can use YouGov to estimate the proportion at each month? Or something
like that. And then we can use that to set the threshold. Add more
gradiation on the 'wanting infection' variable (don't make binary)

Export Pulse data with risky behavior and time information:

```{r}
write.csv(pulse,"data_files/pulse/processed/pulse_risky_information.csv")
```

### 3.3.Risky behavior multiplier

[Discussion about which model to use] Having estimated whether someone
wears a mask in leisure settings, we want to know how much riskier not
wearing a mask is while at leisure. We obtain this risk multiplier using
this Nature study of 198,077 US participants which finds that
self-reported 'sometimes', 'most of the time', and 'always' use of face
mask was associated with an average 68% reduced risk of predicted
COVID-19 compared to individuals who wore face masks none of the time.
Findings are consistent with this CDC study that finds mask wearing
reduced risk of infection by 70%. In line with the Nature study, we say
that, for risk-takers, a hour spent at leisure is 3.125 (1/0.32) times
riskier.

### 3.4 People in household

If someone lives alone we assign a risk multiplier of 0 because hours
spent alone at home are not risky. We use the Pulse question, *How many
total people (adults and children) currently live in your household,
including youself?* to set the binary varibale, **lives_with_others**

```{r}
pulse$lives_with_others <- ifelse(pulse$num_household > 1,1,0)
```

### 3.5.Compute risk model

To recap: we are ultimately interested in understanding risk specific to
the workplace, so we want to distribute infections between those
occurring at work, leisure, or at home. If a Pulse respondent had covid
and we believed they were equally likely to have gotten it in any of the
settings, we would simply attribute 1/3 of the infection to each.
Instead, we believe that the likelihood an infection occured in the
setting is a function of how much time they spend there and how risky
they are in the setting. We gathered three pieces of information:

1.  Time in each setting by work category (ATUS)
2.  Risky behavior during leisure hours (YouGov + Pulse)
3.  People in household (Pulse)

We assume that if someone is risky, an hour spent at leisure is 3.125
times riskier. We also assume that if someone lives alone, there is 0
risk in their household setting.

#### 3.5.1. Reshape data

To capture risk specific to each setting in our model, we create three
subrespondents for every respondent: a "work respondent," a "leisure
respondent," and a "home respondent". Each subrespondent is given a
weight of one-third.

We create an infection variable (I) with four categories:

-   no infection
-   infection at home
-   infection at work
-   infection at leisure

For a respondent who reports to Pulse that they've not been infected,
all three subrespondents fall into the "no infection" category in our
infection variable (I). For a respondent who reports to Pulse that they
have been infected, the work subrespondent will fall into the "infection
at work" category, the leisure subrespondent will fall into the
"infection at leisure" category, and the home subrespondent will fall
into the "infection at home" category. Because we don't want to
distribute an infection equally across each setting, we take the
following steps to subdivide the single infection into shares reflecting
the likelihood that the infection occurs in each setting:

1.  Assign number of hours in each setting
2.  Assign risk multiplier for each setting
3.  Calculate the "proportion" of the infection occurring in a given
    setting by multipliying hours in the setting by the riskiness
    multiplier and dividing by total, risky-adjusted hours.
4.  Multiply each proportion by 3 so weighted infections still sum to 1.

For example, for a Pulse respondent who is risky during leisure and
lives alone:

| Respondent  | Weight | Time setting | Risky multiplier | No infection | Home covid | Work covid | Leisure covid 
|-------------|--------|--------------|------------------|--------------|------------|------------|---------------
| HomeResp    | 1/3    | 12           | 0                | 0            | 0          | 0          | 0             
| LeisureResp | 1/3    | 4            | 3.125            | 0            | 0          | 0          | 1.83          
| WorkResp    | 1/3    | 8            | 1                | 0            | 0          | 1.17       | 0             

We create a measure of past covid contraction using the following Pulse
survey question:

-   Has a doctor or other health care provider ever told you that you
    have COVID-19?
        1.  Yes
        2.  No
        3.  Not sure

"Yes" responses are marked as having had Covid-19 and given a 1, while
"No" and "Not sure" are both marked as never having had Covid and given
a 0.

```{r}
pulse <- pulse %>%
  filter(had_covid > 0) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(split_weight = 1/3,
         id = row_number())
```


```{r}
split_pulse <- rbind(pulse %>% mutate(respondent = "HomeResp"),
        pulse %>% mutate(respondent = "LeisureResp"),
        pulse %>% mutate(respondent = "WorkResp"))
```

```{r}
split_pulse <- split_pulse %>%
  mutate(time_setting = case_when(
    respondent == "HomeResp" ~ Time_At_Home,
    respondent == "LeisureResp" ~ Time_At_Leisure,
    respondent == "WorkResp" ~ Time_At_Workplace,
    respondent == "WorkResp" ~ Time_At_Workplace,
  ),
  risky_multiplier = case_when(
    respondent == "HomeResp" ~ lives_with_others,
    respondent == "WorkResp" ~ 1,
    respondent == "LeisureResp" & is_risky == 1 ~ 3.125,
    respondent == "LeisureResp" & is_risky == 0 ~ 1
  ),
  had_covid = ifelse(had_covid == 1,1,0),
  no_infection = abs(had_covid-1),
  home_covid = ifelse(respondent == "HomeResp",
                      had_covid * time_setting * risky_multiplier,0),
  work_covid = ifelse(respondent == "WorkResp",
                      had_covid * time_setting * risky_multiplier,0),
  leisure_covid = ifelse(respondent == "LeisureResp",
                         had_covid * time_setting * risky_multiplier,0)) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(id) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(total = sum(home_covid + work_covid + leisure_covid + no_infection)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(home_covid = home_covid/total * 3,
                work_covid = work_covid/total * 3,
                leisure_covid = leisure_covid/total * 3,
                no_infection = no_infection/total * 3)
```

As a sanity check, we want to make sure we obtain the same number of
covid infections and respodents without covid:

```{r}
pulse %>%
  mutate(covid = ifelse(had_covid == 1,"covid","nocovid")) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(covid) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(count = n()) %>%
  kable()
```

```{r}
split_pulse %>%
  mutate(covid = (home_covid + leisure_covid + work_covid)*split_weight,
         nocovid = no_infection * split_weight) %>%
  summarise(covid = sum(covid),
            nocovid = sum(nocovid)) %>%
  kable()
```

Now, looking at covid in each of the settings:

```{r}
split_pulse %>%
  summarise(home = sum(home_covid * split_weight),
            work = sum(work_covid * split_weight),
            leisure = sum(leisure_covid * split_weight)) %>%
  mutate(total=home+work+leisure) %>%
  kable()
```

Exporting Pulse data with split respondents:

```{r}
write.csv(split_pulse,"data_files/pulse/processed/split_pulse.csv")
```

#### 3.5.2. Run risk model

```{r}
split_pulse <- read.csv("data_files/pulse/processed/split_pulse.csv")
```

```{r}
df <- split_pulse %>%
  select(race_ethnicity,weight,state,job,split_weight,no_infection,home_covid,work_covid,leisure_covid)
```

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  gather(type,infected,no_infection,home_covid,leisure_covid,work_covid) %>%
  mutate(split_weight = split_weight * infected) %>%
  select(-infected) %>%
  filter(split_weight > 0)
```

```{r}
temp <- df %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  sample_n(100)
```

```{r}
test <- multinom(type ~ job + race_ethnicity + state + (race_ethnicity*state), weights = split_weight, data = temp,MaxNWts = 10000)
```
